## Low Speed I/O - TOFE Expansion board

While the [Numato Opsis board](https://numato.com/product/numato-opsis-fpga-based-open-video-platform)
has a massive amount of high speed I/O interfaces, it doesn't include many
features for interfacing with more pedestrian speed devices such as buttons or
LEDs. To help solve this problem “Low speed I/O” TOFE expansion board was
created.

## Features

The "Low Speed I/O" board has the following features;

 * 1 x Arduino compatible pin header. (With on board ADC enabling analog pins
   support.)

 * 4 x [Digilent Pmod™ Compatible](http://www.digilentinc.com/Pmods/licensing.cfm)
   headers[1] to allow usage of existing expansion boards,
   including boards from 
   [Numato Lab](http://numato.com/fpga-boards/filter/cat/expansion-modules.html?limit=30),
   [Digilent](http://digilentinc.com/pmods),
   [Maxim](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/design-technology/fpga-design-resources/pmod-compatible-plug-in-peripheral-modules.html) and
   [Analog](https://wiki.analog.com/resources/alliances/xilinx#pmods).

 * 1 x USB-UART, allowing low speed serial operation.

 * 6 x Indicator LEDs

 * 4 x Push Buttons

[1]: Two of the Pmod headers share pins with the Arduino header. This means
that when the Arduino compatible pin header is in use only 2 Pmod headers are
available.
